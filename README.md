# Campfire Dashboard

> Admin interface for Campfire using Nuxt.js and Firebase for authentification.

The goal of this project is to make it really easy to generate an application that has Firebase (authentication + user account management) setup out-of-the-box.

## Demo Login

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
